# For the project you want to build, create the root directory manually.
# The file containing the project structure (as above) MUST be named "project-structure" (no extension)
# This file MUST be located in the root directory of the project.
# Also paste the project-builder.py file in the same directory.

# project-structure file requirements:

# the first line of this file identifies the project root directory and have no indentation
# the root directory in this document MUST match the actual project root directory name

# visually connect the subdirectories and files to their parent directories
# using non-alphanumeric characters such as /, |, \, -, +, *, etc.
# specifically, avoid using 1 or L as art, because art needs to be strictly non-alphanumeric

# This connection should be clear and lead from parent to child 
# the subdirectories should be indented to show their hierarchy
# the root and subdirectory names MUST end with a /
# have at least one clear space between the "art" and the subfolder or file name

# comments are accepted and should start with a # sign
# filenames extensions are optional
